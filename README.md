## Project goals
Identified and described business problems or areas of interest that are related to
the American owned airlines. 

Big data pipeline involves investigation and exploration of the big data before
performing analysis and developing a set of conclusions.

At the end of the big data pipeline, evaluated the effectiveness of the analytics solutions in terms of
predictive accuracies as well as system scalability.

The evaluation of the results, conclusions, and suggested solutions are supported by metrics collected during the
machine learning flow.
